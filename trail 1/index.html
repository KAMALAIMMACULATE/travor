<h2> BORN A CRIME </h2>
<p>Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of the show began with a criminal act. Trevor was born to a man who was a Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at the time when such relationship was not allowed because it was a crime for a white man to fall in love or make a relationship with a black and once found in such act you were to be prisoned for five years as a punishment. So Born a crime is the background story of young Noah growing up in a hard life of struggle finding himself in a place where he was not supposed to exist. I am really interested in this story because it tries to show me the love of a mother to a child as Noah’s mother managed to take care of her kid and taking all the responsibilities like care, education, parental love and showing him the way to GOD because Noah’s mother was a prayerful woman and that was a very good character to build a child to become better in the future.</p>

<h3>The run of Trevor</h3>
 	
<p>It is truly shown that Noah’s mother was a strong, courageous, hardworking and caring for example, she showed her love and ability when he threw Trevor out of the car which was moving .this act happened on Sunday when Trevor was a young boy of nine years. The mother was deeply a religious woman and Trevor was addicted to the mother’s character of going for prayers every Sunday and living a prayerful life. His mother was stubborn as she was religious for example she said “it is the devil that does not want us to go church” She said so when they faced with some difficulties on the road by the car. This was a hard time that Trevor faced because he used to balance payers and studies whereby sometimes he used to reach to school very late, but this was not the end of his suffering, He also suffered when he got a mechanic who became the husband to the mother and also his stepfather who toured him and the mother.
Born a crime “Noah” it is because due to the fact that he was light skinned boy born of the black woman called Patricia, which was really a crime during the apartheid policy. This made her mother to act as if she was not a mother to Noah for example when they used to move to the market or for an outing show the would  request a neighbor and light skinned like Noah pretending to be the real mother to him and Patricia acting as the housemaid following them.</p>

<h4>Patricia the second girl</h4>
<p>The second girl, this story is good because Noah tries to identify the character of the mother and the life she lived in with the grand parents who handled him like a special person because he was a white, Noah’s mother spent twelve years without seeing her family, she knew English thought she did not go to school, but she was helped by a pastor and he helped her to get a new job a factory nearby a town and this is where her life changed.</p>
<h5>Fufi the beloved dog</h5>
<p>Noah and her mother lived a happy life though they were passing through a poor and hard life, they used to communicate using letter writing and this was the best time they hard best they used a good English while writing these letters, however they also loved animals like dogs. Her mother came back home as she had bought the puppies and called them Fufi and another panther. Noah loved his puppy to an extend that it was his friend because he did not have children to play with, so fufi was the best friend he had, however he was disappointed by Fufi when she jumped to a neighbor’s house and stayed there for a time till when he entered in the gate of the neighbor asking for Fufi but they ended by refusing that the dog was theirs but he continued telling his dog to come but it could not un till he went back home crying and the mother finding him crying, when she asked him what the problem was, he said that Fufi was taken by the neighbor and Fufi refused to come with him, Her mother went there and brought Fufi back home, which brought back Trevor’s happiness.
